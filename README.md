# What is this?
A re-imagining of Minecraft, With narcisim in the name! /s\
This project aims to
 - First, replicate the Minecraft 1.2.5 experience
 - Then fill it with useless "features" until it becomes a bloated pimple of a game

All on the minetest game engine!

## Huh?
Behold; a faithful (to as far as I can be bothered) recreation of Minecraft. Featuring a similar (but legally distinct) art-style.\
Aiming to tug on your nostalgia strings to gain some street-cred.\
Although, it does also add features, that 1.2.5 didn't have. Not anything post-1.6.4, mind you! That all sucks!

## Come again?
*Note: this is the informal, comedic version. Please see the license section for a more legally binding notice.*\
I was going to license this under the Unlicense (and indeed, the seperately licensed `mods/brpdinv` is), but I remembered the people on the internet suck.\
So instead of doing that, This is licensed under the MIT License.

## What?
This project is also self-hosting, in that every mod here was (at-least in part, with odd exception such as `mods/mobs`) made by me.\
This includes textures. Sounds may have been sampled from [Free Sound](https://freesound.org/), but they are attributed and the license upheld. See the License section for more details.\
**This does however, mean that it is incompatible with most, if not all currently existing mods! This Project does NOT attempt to be compatible with currently existing content!**
Minetest_Game is cool, but I can do it myself, thank-you-very much.

I will not take credit for all of the desgin, however. As certain mods (usually acknowleged in comments of the `.lua` files) have had inspiration drawn from minetest_game.

# Features I want to add, but do not know how!
For these, please get in contact with me (probably through GitHub) if you know how.
 - ## Dimensions
   I have a rough idea, based on what MineClone 2 does, which is to place them at different insane heights.
 - ## Accurate 1.2.5 worldgen.
   We don't get much control over what minetest does when generating, so it may take an engine patch to accomplish this.\
   This is out of the scope of the project, so it may just be a far-flung dream.\
   I don't see it being too difficult to convert, however. Decompile 1.2.5 with MCP, Look at the code, and convert it.\
   From there is an issue of handling random number generation. This could actually end up being too slow.\
   And then maybe some legal issuses lol

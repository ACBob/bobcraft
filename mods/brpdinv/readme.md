# What is this
This is "Bob's Really cool Public-Domain Inventory", a re-implementation of minetest_game's SFINV in the public domain.\
Being that this has no direct dependencies with bobcraft, it is licensed explicitly so you may use it as a mod/component in your own games.

This is essentially intended to be the most libre possible implementation of the API. Basically, for those projects who want an sfinv-like experience, but without its' baggage of the MIT license.

# what is this not
Intended to over-take/replace sfinv. I fully see sfinv remaining the top dog, given the amount of games based on minetest_game.\
I also encourage you to use sfinv instead, the MIT license isn't as dire as the GPL, and it's maintained by... well, most of the minetest_game team.
